# Lab2-JS-Frameworks

## Description
This project is an exploration of JavaScript functions and modules using Node.js. It consists of two main files: `index.js`, which serves as the entry point for the application, and `module.js`, which contains various utility functions.

The main goals of this project are:
- To demonstrate the use of ES6 modules for organizing code effectively.
- To implement a set of functions that perform various tasks, such as:
  - Printing a welcome message.
  - Converting measurement units (Celsius to Fahrenheit).
  - Performing mathematical operations (e.g., calculating the square of a number).
  - Implementing an advanced function to check for prime numbers.

The application is designed to be run in a Node.js environment, and it showcases the ability to create reusable functions that can be easily imported and utilized in different parts of the code.


## Features
- Modular design using ES6 syntax.
- Functionality to print personalized messages.
- Unit conversion capabilities.
- Basic mathematical computations.
- Prime number validation.
